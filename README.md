# cpp-config-system

A simple to learn wrapper for creating configs for your applications.

## Prerequisites

None. Just include the files in your project, look up how to use it and you're ready to go!

## Notes

The layout is extremely similar to XML, which makes it easy to use and write configs manually for (in case you'd
ever have to.) An example.xml file is provided, and so is an example.cpp file which shows how to read/save values
from/to a file.
